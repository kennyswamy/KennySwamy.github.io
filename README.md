Portfolio Projects
Below are some of the key projects included in this portfolio. Each project has its own directory containing all relevant files, including datasets, notebooks, and a dedicated README for an in-depth explanation.

Virtual Tissue Simulation
Implemented an intricate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, seamlessly integrating pre-trained Language Models (LLM) for nuanced
information retrieval. Executed a dynamic text summarization pipeline with a rolling context window, optimizing prompts for superior results. Developed
a Python script for t-SNE-based visualization of LLM embeddings on academic paper fragments, utilizing advanced natural language processing for
semantic encoding and enriched topic clustering 
- what was the challenge, the approach taken, technologies used, and the outcome.

Evolution Of Wildfire
In a sophisticated Virtual Reality (VR) model project, cutting-edge Data Mining techniques were utilized alongside Python for data preprocessing and R for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handling a massive 45 GB dataset with precision. This facilitated a detailed visualization of wildfire evolution across various terrains, revealing complex environmental patterns and trends in a concise, comprehensive manner. 
- what was the challenge, the approach taken, technologies used, and the outcome.

Social Media Community Identification and Analysis
Pioneered the identification and analysis of social media communities by leveraging Python's Praw library for robust Reddit data extraction and advanced filtering techniques for precise information discernment. Employing K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithms within a machine learning framework facilitated efficient community classification, while network graph visualizations showcased a deep understanding of community dynamics and intricate topic clustering patterns.
